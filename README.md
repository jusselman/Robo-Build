## Robobuild: Customizable Product Scaffolding

The purpose of Robobuild is to effectively provide clients with 
a framework for e-commerce. The UI/UX will vary considerably based 
on the product, however, the constant is the ability for a user 
to customize their product, be it apparel, food, skateboards, any item with numerous parts to be constructed together. It then stores the orders visually on the page, and also on the backend through 
Firebase.
